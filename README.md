# Plural Agent for Kubernetes

Plural Agent for Kubernetes is an active in-cluster component for solving any Plural<->Kubernetes integration tasks.

It's implemented as two communicating pieces - Plural Agent (`agentk`) that is running in the cluster and Plural Agent Server (`gitlab-kas`) that is running on the Plural side. Please see the [architecture](doc/architecture.md) document and other documents in the [doc](doc) directory for more information. [User-facing documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) is also available.
